# Product Backlog

This list represents features that are ideas that have been entirely fleshed out, but are general use cases that this application should support someday.

1. The Return Assumptions / Historical Data Summary should have a slider to configure SORR for the simulation. Sliding left means poorer returns early, sliding right is the opposite. Starts in the middle, which is random. UX should show a red to green gradient on/below the slider from left to right.
2. AI Chat
  * You can chat with an AI and get advice on the spot in regards to spending / modeling. It has access to all your data. It can also take actions on your behalf, like "Run a sim with X, Y, Z parameters". 
  * Group Chat: You can @mention your advisor with questions in the chat. They see the dashboard you are currently on and chat with you about it.
3. Every change is recorded in a log that supports undo and redo.
4. User can take "snapshots" at any time to create named versions.
