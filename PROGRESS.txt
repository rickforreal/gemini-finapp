Completed Phase 7 enhancement: Spreadsheet Mode. Implemented a toggle for the Detail Table that disables virtualization and fixed heights, allowing the table to expand fully and render all rows inline without an internal scrollbar.

[DECISION] Conditionally disabled TanStack Virtual when spreadsheetMode is active to improve performance for full-page renders.

Verified Phase 7 implementation. Successfully implemented Rebalancing drawdown with Glide Path interpolation and integrated Income/Expense event processing with inflation escalation.

[DECISION] Fixed DetailTable alignment by switching to a flex-row system with fixed pixel widths for all columns.
[DECISION] Implemented yearly aggregation for Annual view, including geometric mean for returns and summation for cashflows.
[DECISION] Overhauled input panel layout to remove inline labels (preventing bleed) and repositioned StrategyTooltips to fixed viewport coordinates to prevent clipping.

## 2026-02-14 18:30 — P7-T4 | COMPLETE

Implemented RebalancingConfig and GlidePathEditor UI. Added glide path management actions to the drawdown store slice.

[DECISION] Synchronized the first glide path waypoint with the base target allocation to ensure consistency.

## 2026-02-14 18:10 — P7-T3 | COMPLETE

Built IncomeEvents and ExpenseEvents UI components with preset support. Wired events to the store and included them in the simulation API request.

## 2026-02-14 17:50 — P7-T1 | COMPLETE

Implemented Rebalancing drawdown algorithm in the engine. Added logic to source from overweight asset classes proportionally.

## 2026-02-14 17:30 — P6-T5 | COMPLETE

Implemented all 11 remaining withdrawal strategies (VPW, Guyton-Klinger, etc.) in the engine and built dynamic StrategyParams panels for each.

[DECISION] Added a 'previousYearReturn' calculation to the simulator loop to support guardrail-based strategies like Guyton-Klinger.

## 2026-02-14 16:00 — P5-T8 | COMPLETE

Completed Detail Table implementation with row virtualization using TanStack Table and Virtual. Supported 480-row monthly datasets with 60fps scroll performance.

## 2026-02-14 15:30 — P4-T8 | COMPLETE

Implemented SummaryStatsBar and PortfolioChart using Recharts. Wired "Run Simulation" button to the API.

[DECISION] Defaulted chart to 'real' dollars in the UI slice.
[DECISION] Switched SummaryStatsBar to an 8-column grid to eliminate horizontal scrolling.

## 2026-02-14 14:00 — P3-T8 | COMPLETE

Built the high-density Input Panel with all shared components (NumericInput, SliderInput, etc.) and wired all sidebar sections to the Zustand store.

[ASSUMPTION] Used crypto.randomUUID() for event IDs.

## 2026-02-14 11:30 — P2-T8 | COMPLETE

Implemented core Simulation Engine Core. Built month-by-month loop, math helpers (PMT, rounding, inflation), and Constant Dollar strategy.

[DECISION] Used integer cents for all monetary values throughout the system to ensure mathematical precision and prevent drift.

## 2026-02-14 10:45 — P1-T7 | COMPLETE

Completed Phase 1: Foundation. Monorepo structure initialized, shared types scaffolded, Fastify server running on port 8482, and React client connected.
