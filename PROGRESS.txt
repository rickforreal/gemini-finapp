Completed Phase 8: Monte Carlo. Implemented historical return sampling from 1926-2024 data with era filtering. Built a high-performance Monte Carlo runner capable of 1,000 simulations in ~1.1s. Integrated MC results into the UI with layered confidence bands (5th-95th percentiles) and a color-coded Probability of Success stat card.

[DECISION] Optimized MC runner by using TypedArrays (Float64Array) and single-pass percentile calculations to meet performance targets.
[DECISION] Modified simulator to support external return sequences and CAPE ratios for historical accuracy.
[DECISION] Standardized all @shared imports across the server package and verified with full typecheck.
